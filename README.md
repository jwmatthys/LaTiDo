# Latido, the Sight Singing game

Imagine if Aural Skills was a game. You are given a melody, you sing it into the microphone on your computer or mobile device, and you are rated 1-5 stars. Perform well and you level up to harder melodies and rhythms.

LaTiDo is a cross-platform app under development, using a sophisticated pitch tracking algorithm and a custom evaluation rubric.

This project is supported in part by a Carroll University faculty development grant.
